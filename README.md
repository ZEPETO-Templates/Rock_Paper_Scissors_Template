## 🔨 Tools

**Game prefab**
To make things easier, there is a prefab called "RPS_Game" that you can drag into your game scene, and the mini-game will be already functional. You just need to place it wherever you want.

**UIManager**
In the UIManager you have some options to tweak how the game looks like.
